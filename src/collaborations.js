    A type of food collaboration was the McDonald collaboration.

    Both McDonald's and HotWheels were family oriented products, which mainly
   
    focused on kids. McDonald's Happy Meal started in 1979, and used the same
   
    approach with Hotwheels to sell its happy meals. In 1991, both companies
   
    merged products to better sell to both families and kids.
    
    The year 1991, the first ever Happy Meals were sold with Hotwheel toys
    inside.
   
    The Hotwheels Blue Card Series were the cars mostly found in the Happy
    Meals.
    
    Some of these included the Camaro Z-28 white and the 57 T-Bird(1978).
