# Git Repository Name
# reactapp_hotwheelsinfo

# My Notes
# The reacapp_hotwheelsinfo had a previous type error of a function
# that I could not fix inside bundle.js,so i needed to recreate a new react app 
# name it fixed_hotwheels_reactapp that reset/fixed the bundle.js 
# also, cloned reactapp_hotwheelsinfo git repository into the fixed_hotwheels_reactapp folder only brings all folders and files, and 
# does not include node_modules
